# nvidia-rt-stuff

Misc. collection of nvidia-rt related patches for linux-rt. old / backup. Some are experimental for testing and probably will not apply over new driver versions... this is really just a backup and I wouldn't advise using these patches... Stick with how your linux distribution packages the nvidia drivers or how an -rt maintainer does things!
